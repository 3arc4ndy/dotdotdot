    <h1>WJEC Level 3 Medical Science Leaflet</h1>
    <p>This leaflet provides  information for Unit 2: Physiological measurement techniques in the WJEC Level 3 Applied Certificate/Diploma in Medical Science. It details flow, blood pressure, ECG, and the heart cycle, covering principles, significance of data, limitations, and patient management aspects such as confidentiality and conduct. All diagrams are explained to meet assessment criteria.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Peak Flow</h2>
        <p>Peak expiratory flow rate assessment is a lung function test that tests the maximal airflow velocity during forced expiration(breathing out), providing insights respiratory health, especially in conditions like asthma.</p>
        
        <h3>Review of the Respiratory System</h3>
        <p>The respiratory system facilitates gas exchange, supplying oxygen to tissues and expelling carbon dioxide. Key structures include the nasal cavity (filters and warms air), pharynx, larynx (voice production), trachea (supported by cartilage rings), bronchi and bronchioles (air conduction, with smooth muscle in bronchioles for regulation), and alveoli (gas exchange sites, one cell thick, surrounded by capillaries). Adaptations for efficiency: large surface area (millions of alveoli), thin barriers, moist surfaces, and rich blood supply. Secondary functions: olfaction via nasal fibers and speech production.</p>
        <img src="https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:eco%2Cw_700/MTc2MjQzNzQ3MDM2ODAwNDI1/what-is-the-respiratory-system.webp" alt="Labelled Diagram of the Respiratory System">
        <p class="diagram-explanation">This diagram depicts the human respiratory system, labelling structures such as the nasal cavity, trachea, bronchi, and alveoli, illustrating the pathway for air and sites of gas exchange between oxygen and carbon dioxide.</p>

<grok-card data-id="9df9d9" data-type="image_card"  data-arg-size="LARGE" ></grok-card>

        
        <h3>Principle</h3>
        <p>The test evaluates the highest rate of air expulsion from the lungs after a full inhale, using a portable peak flow meter where exhalation propels a marker along a calibrated scale in dm³/min. Accuracy relies on proper technique, as patient effort can give inacurrate results.</p>
        
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Used to detect any airway inflammation or narrowing, helping to diagnose asthma and take proper steps for patient, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) monitoring, or other respiratory issues..</p>
        
        <h3>How It's Measured</h3>
        <p>As a medical professional, make sure everything is meticilous to produce reliable data. Begin by verifying the meter's calibration(bar is fully horizontal) and hygiene, using a disposable mouthpiece.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Give a clear and proper explanation to the patient about the peak flow test and its purpose, gain consent to start test, adressing any concerns the patient may have to minimise anxiety.</li>
            <li>Position the patient standing straight or upright, either standing or sitting down for maximum lung expansion.</li>
            <li>Reset the peak flow meter to the lowest scale point possible, usually, the marker should be completely horziontal.</li>
            <li>instruct patient to inhale deeply until they cant anymore, then instruct to seal their lips around the mouth piece, insuring tongue doesnt obstruct it. Blow out a rapid, forced exhalation and sustain effort briefly. </li>
            <li>Record the reading where the marker  stops, and repeat twice or more for accurate results, selecting the highest values of each to allow for the measurement of a mean.</li>
            <li>Document results securely, informing the patient of next steps.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Significance of Data</h3>
        <p>Adult norms range from 400–600 dm³/min for both genders. Values within this suggest unobstructed airways; below may indicate constriction, warranting further investigation like spirometry. Compare to personal best or predicted values based on age, height, sex; track trends for disease control.</p>
        
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Effort-dependent: patient effort on exhalation or poor technique gives innacurate results.</li>
            <li>Variability across devices; standardize use.</li>
            <li>Any recent health indicators like having a cough can diminish results.</li>
            <li>Should not be the only test that is preformed to have an insight in patients airways.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Blood Pressure</h2>
        <p>blood pressure represents the force blood exerts on artery vessel walls, expressed as systolic over diastolic in mmHg.</p>
        
        <h3>Review of the Heart</h3>
        <p>The heart is a pump with four chambers: right atrium (receives deoxygenated blood from vena cava), right ventricle (pumps to lungs via pulmonary artery), left atrium (oxygenated blood from pulmonary veins), left ventricle (pumps to body via aorta). Valves (tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, aortic) to prevent backflow. Blood flow: superior/inferior vena cava to right atrium to tricuspid to right ventricle to pulmonary valve to pulmonary artery to lungs to pulmonary veins to left atrium to left ventricle to aortic valve to aorta.</p>

        <p class="diagram-explanation">This diagram labels heart structures including chambers, valves, and major vessels, showing the direction of flow of deoxygenated (blue) and oxygenated (red) blood through the cardiac circuit.</p>

<grok-card data-id="e234b6" data-type="image_card"  data-arg-size="LARGE" ></grok-card>

        
        <h3>Principle</h3>
        <p>Utilizes obstruction of brachial artery flow via a  attached to a sphygmometer(mercury or mechanical manometer measures the pressure.), detecting when blood starts to flow through the artery once more. Systolic: first sound; diastolic: no sound. Influenced by cardiac output, vascular resistance; factors like age, hormones, diet modulate.</p>
        
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Identifies hypertension (>140/90) or hypotension (<90/60), monitors therapy, screens for risks like atherosclerosis or organ damage.</p>
        
        <h3>How It's Measured</h3>
        <p>Adhere to standardized protocol for accuracy, as variations can misinform clinical decisions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inform patient of the reading, and secure consent, advise patient to wear loose fitting clothes for easy access to arm.</li>
            <li>Make sure the patient is calm; avoid caffeine, exercise 30 minutes prior; empty bladder if needed.</li>
            <li>Seat patient with their back supported, feet flat, legs uncrossed, arm bare, supported at heart level.</li>
            <li>Select appropriate cuff size, position 2-3 cm (1 inch) above elbow.</li>
            <li>Place cuff in the middle of the upper arm with a tube that connects to the monitor facing upwards and in line with the brachial artery. Start reading.</li>
            <li>Cuff will inflate until blood flow in the brachial artery stops, ensure comfort of patient as blackage at this point may be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>A pressure reading is taken when blood starts to flow again, this is systolic pressure, where there is no sound this means presure falls to a point where no sound can be heard, this is disatolic</li>
            <li>automatic blood pressure monitor will display results of systolic and diastolic pressure, these numbers will be used to see if patients blood pressure levels fall into the healthy range.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Significance of Data</h3>
        <p>Age-adjusted norms: 20s ~125/80, 40s ~135/85. Deviations prompt evaluation; e.g., elevated suggests vascular strain, low may indicate hypovolemia.</p>
        
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>White coat effect or daily fluctuations.</li>
            <li>Technique errors: improper cuff, positioning, deflation rate.</li>
            <li>Arrhythmias distort readings.</li>
            <li>Patient factors: movement, obesity (cuff mismatch).</li>
            <li>May induce anxiety or stress, causing reading to be off.</li>
            <li>Obesity.</li>
            <li>Rapid pressure change.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Electrocardiogram (ECG)</h2>
        <p>An ECG captures cardiac electrical activity using electrodes placed on the body, aiding detection of rhythm.</p>
        
        <h3>Principle</h3>
        <p>Measures electrical impulses in the heart indicating the heart’s rhythm and heart rate. Many types of ECG, like resting, ECG when you're under stress(excerise), Ambulatory ECG.</p>
        
        <h3>Calculating heart rate from an ECG</h3>
        <p>How many boxes 1 second take?</p>
        <p>How many boxes is R-R peak?</p>
        <p>Divide R-R boxes by boxes for 1 second.</p>
        <p>Divide 60 by time for 1 beat.</p>
        
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Spots problems like irregular beats (arrhythmias), poor blood supply (ischaemia).</p>
        
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>Precision in electrode placement is critical for accurate trace.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Explain test, duration (~5-10 min), and obtain consent, assure no pain of patient.</li>
            <li>Ensure privacy. And pateint relaxation, remove upper clothing and jewelry (provide gown if necessary.) shave hairy areas if necessary.</li>
            <li>Clean skin with alcohol; apply conductive gel if dry.</li>
            <li>Stick 10 electrodes on patient, 6 on chest and 4 on arms and legs</li>
            <li>Connect leads per color codes.</li>
            <li>instruct the patient to remain still, breathe normally.</li>
            <li>Review for artifacts; repeat if poor quality; document with patient details, date.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Significance of Data</h3>
        
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The recording is brief.</li>
            <li>Movement or poor sticker contact causes blurry lines.</li>
            <li>A normal ECG doesn't rule out all heart problems.</li>
            <li>Requires skilled interpretation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Heart Cycle (Cardiac Cycle)</h2>
        <p>The cardiac cycle is everything that happens relating to the heart in a singular beat.<p>
        
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Keeps blood flowing in the right direction. Helps spot problems like weak squeezing or valve leaks.</p>
        
        <h3>Phases</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Atrial Systole:</strong> The atria (top chambers) contract (this is the P wave on ECG). They push the last bit of blood into the ventricles (bottom chambers).</li>
            <li><strong>Ventricular Systole:</strong> The ventricles contract hard (this is the QRS wave on ECG). Pressure rises, closing the AV valves (first heart sound "lub") and opening valves to the arteries. Blood is pumped out – to lungs (right side) and body (left side).</li>
            <li><strong>Diastole/Filling:</strong> Ventricles relax (T wave on ECG). Pressure drops, valves to arteries close (second heart sound "dub"). AV valves open again, and blood flows in from atria (mostly passive, some from atrial squeeze).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cycle duration ~0.8s at 75 bpm.</p>
        
        <h3>Significance of Data</h3>
        <p>ECG shows the electrical timing of the cycle, Problems show up as wrong wave shapes, extra sounds, or pressure changes.</p>
        
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>Cardiac cycle alone doesnt reflect heart health.</p>

        <h2>Dealing with Patients - Confidentiality and Professional Conduct</h2>
        
        <h3>Patient Confidentiality (NHS Guidelines)</h3>
        <p>Confidentiality safeguards patient data under common law. Duty arises from implied trust; breaches only justified legally or for public safety. Principles ensure minimal, justified use; inform patients; appoint guardians for oversight.</p>
        <p><strong>The 8 Caldicott Principles:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Justify purpose for data use.</li>
            <li>Use only when essential.</li>
            <li>Minimize personal data.</li>
            <li>Need-to-know access.</li>
            <li>Staff awareness of duties.</li>
            <li>Legal compliance.</li>
            <li>Balance sharing for care with protection.</li>
            <li>Transparent information practices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Secure storage, consent for sharing.</p>
        
        <h3>Professional Conduct Towards Patients</h3>
        <p>Embody NHS values: respect, compassion. Empathize by validating feelings, using reflective statements; maintain calm, non-judgmental tone; simplify language, avoid jargon; adapt for vulnerabilities. Non-verbal cues foster trust; ensure dignity, especially in ECG exposure.</p>
